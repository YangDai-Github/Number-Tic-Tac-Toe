    <string name="text2">As in normal tic-tac-toe, in order to win, you must occupy three consecutive squares in the same row, column or diagonal.\nThe difference is that players will fight with numbers 0~8, and the larger number can occupy the square where the opponent\'s smaller number is located.\nWhen both sides have no remaining numbers but no winner has been decided, the game will not draw directly, but will sum the numbers in the grid, and the sum is smaller The player with will win.\nPlayers cannot reoccupy a square already occupied by themselves, nor can they use numbers that have already been used. In the game, the player first selects the number to be used by \"selecting number\", and then clicks on the square to be occupied. Click \"restart\" to start a new round. In pve mode, the game will randomly designate the first player. </string>
